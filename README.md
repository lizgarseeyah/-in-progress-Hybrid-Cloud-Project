# (in-progress) Hybrid Cloud Project

This project has multiple goals: gain experience migrating from on-premise to the cloud and deploy a web application in a blue green deployment scenario. It will also demonstrate how to leverage cloud technologies using best practices at each level. This project has been divided into three parts:

**Part 1: Web Application and Python Program** _(Done)_

The first part of this program uses a python program to analyze Covid-19 data and renders the output to a dynamic web page.

**Part 2: Migrate to the Cloud** _(10/3, complete cloud architecture by Friday 10,2)_

The goal in part 2 is to migrate the resources in part 1, which is hosted on a BigTwin 2029BZ-HNR Supermicro Server located in San Jose, to rehost this solution in the cloud.

**Part 3: Deploy the Web Application in a Blue-Green Envrionment** _(10/3)_

The third part of this project is to test the functionality of the web app and cloud architecture. The web app will be deployed to a test server (blue environment) first, where the applicaton and architecture will be tested. Once that is completed, the final step in this part is to deploy the application to the production server (green environment).
