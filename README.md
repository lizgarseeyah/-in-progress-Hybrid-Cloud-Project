# Hybrid-Cloud-Project

The purpose of the this project is to leverage cloud resources to deploy a web application in a blue green deployment scenario. This project will explore how to leverage cloud technologies in different ways and how to apply best practices at each stage. This project has been divided into three parts:

**Part 1: Migrate and Rehost on-prem servers**

For the first part of this project, I will be migrating an architecture on a _[Supermicro Server]_and rehost the services in the AWS environment.

**Part 2: Web Application Development**

This second part will focus on the front-end development of the application. _tbd_

**Part 3: Deploy the Web Application in a Blue-Green Envrionment**

The third part of this project is to test the web app and the network, security, and functionality of the cloud architecture. The web app will be deployed in a blue environment first, where the application, and architecture security, and operation will be tested. Once that is completed, the final step in this project is to deploy the application in the green environment and ensure the architecture and web app meet the requirements.
