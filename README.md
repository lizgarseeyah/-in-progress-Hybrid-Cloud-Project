# (in-progress) Hybrid Cloud Project

This project has multiple goals: gain experience migrating from on-premise to the cloud and deploy a web application in a blue green deployment scenario. It will also demonstrate how to leverage cloud technologies using best practices at each level. This project has been divided into three parts:

- ![#f03c15](modify schematic to include automation/microservices components (i.e. lambda function)) ``
- ![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) ``
- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) ``

**Part 1: Migrate to the Cloud** _(due Thur, 10/1)_

For the first part of this project, I will be migrating an architecture on a BigTwin 2029BZ-HNR Supermicro Server and rehost the services in the AWS environment.

[Part 1 Details](https://github.com/lizgarseeyah/-in-progress-Hybrid-Cloud-Project/blob/master/README-PAGE2.md)

**Part 2: Web Application and Python Program** _(due Tue, 09/29)_

This second part will focus on the front-end development of the application. _tbd_

**Part 3: Deploy the Web Application in a Blue-Green Envrionment** _(due Thur, 10/1)_

The third part of this project is to test the web app and the network, security, and functionality of the cloud architecture. The web app will be deployed in a blue environment first, where the application, and architecture security, and operation will be tested. Once that is completed, the final step in this project is to deploy the application in the green environment and ensure the architecture and web app meet the requirements.
